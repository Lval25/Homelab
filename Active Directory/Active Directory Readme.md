After joining the client machine to the domain, log in using a domain account to verify the connection and access domain resources.

### Step 1: Switch to a Domain Account at Login
1. **Restart the Client Machine**:
   - If not already restarted, reboot the client machine to apply the domain settings.
2. **Access the Login Screen**:
   - On the Windows login screen, click **Other User**.
3. **Enter the Domain Credentials**:
   - Use the following format for the username:
     - `DomainName\Username` (e.g., `example\User1`)
   - Enter the password for the domain account (e.g., `Password123!`).
   - Click **Sign In**.

### Step 2: Verify Domain Account Login
1. **Confirm Login**:
   - Once logged in, the desktop should load with the new domain account settings.
   - Open **File Explorer** and navigate to **This PC** to ensure the user's profile directory (e.g., `C:\Users\User1`) has been created.
2. **Check Domain Membership**:
   - Open **Command Prompt** and run:
     ```powershell
     whoami /upn
     ```
   - The output should display the user‚Äôs UPN (User Principal Name), such as `User1@example.local`.

### Step 3: Test Access to Domain Resources
1. **Access Shared Folders**:
   - Open **File Explorer** and type the domain controller‚Äôs hostname or IP address (e.g., `\\192.168.1.10`) in the address bar.
   - Verify that shared resources are accessible.
2. **Check DNS Resolution**:
   - Open **Command Prompt** and run:
     ```powershell
     nslookup example.local
     ```
   - Ensure the domain controller's IP address is returned.

This step confirms that the domain account is functional on the client machine and has access to domain resources.
