Active Directory Home Lab Environment (VirtualBox)

This project is a step-by-step walkthrough of how I built a virtual Active Directory (AD) home lab environment using VirtualBox. The goal of this lab is to simulate a real-world business network for hands-on experience with system administration and cybersecurity practices.
üîß What I Did

    Set up a Microsoft Server 2019 to run Active Directory services.
    Configured a Domain Controller (DC) to manage users and devices within a custom domain.
    Deployed a PowerShell script to automatically create over 1,000 user accounts in Active Directory.
    Connected a Windows 10 Enterprise client machine to the domain and successfully logged into the newly created user accounts.

üè¢ Why This Lab Matters

    Simulates a corporate IT infrastructure with user management and domain control.
    Provides hands-on practice for managing user authentication, group policies, and network permissions.
    Lays the foundation for testing cybersecurity tools, running penetration tests, and identifying system vulnerabilities in a safe environment.

üì¶ Tools & Resources Used

    [Microsoft Server 2019 ISO] ‚Äì For the Active Directory setup.
    [Windows 10 Enterprise ISO] ‚Äì As a client machine for domain interaction.
    [VirtualBox] ‚Äì For creating and managing virtual machines.
    PowerShell Script ‚Äì Used to bulk-create user accounts in AD.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
  - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) ‚Äì Free virtualization software for managing virtual machines.  
  - [Microsoft Windows Server 2019 ISO (180-day trial)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019) ‚Äì Server OS used to set up the Domain Controller and run Active Directory.  
  - [Windows 10 Enterprise ISO (90-day trial)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-10-enterprise) ‚Äì Client OS used to join the Active Directory domain.  
    Clone or download the PowerShell Script.

Setup Steps

    Install VirtualBox and create two virtual machines: one for Windows Server 2019 and one for Windows 10 Enterprise.
    Install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on the Windows Server VM.
    Promote the server to a Domain Controller (DC) and configure the domain.
    Run the PowerShell script to generate user accounts in Active Directory.
    Join the Windows 10 VM to the domain and test logging in with newly created user accounts.
